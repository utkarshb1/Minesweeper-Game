# Minesweeper-Game
This game has working logic completely opposite to the Original Game


Here first you will have to choose the level of game and based on that the grid will be formed.
The game works on the logic that as soon as you give your first input, the mines will be set at random locations in the grid based on the first input.


Then, by looking at the numbers shown, you have to guess where the mine will be and then you have to insert the mine there (e.g. af3, for inserting mine at 'a' column and 3rd row)


In this way u have to play the game and put the mines.
Once the mines u have put matches with the mines which were set at random location at the starting of the game, it will show that you have won the game.


You have to enter the input like:
  The rows are numbered numerically and columns alphabetically
  So, to give a input, type <column alphabet><row number><f (if you want to insert mine at that location/ else don't type anything)>
  
  
  
Enjoy Mineswipping !!! ;)
